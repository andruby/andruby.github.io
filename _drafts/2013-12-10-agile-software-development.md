This is my take on Agile software development, as defined in the original "Agile Manifesto".

## Agile Core Values

* **Individuals and interactions** over Processes and tools
* **Working software** over Comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over Contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over Following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Traditional corporate environments often stress the values on the right, so
it is safe to assume that the authors positioned the Agile values specifically 
against them.

From my experience practicing Agile software development in teams ranging from
1 to 7 developers, I fully agree with and appreciate these values.

## Agile Principles

Taken from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_principles)
which paraphrases from the Manifesto. My notes are included under each principle.

1. Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software<br>
test
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Working software is the principal measure of progress
5. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
6. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
7. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
8. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11. Self-organizing teams
12. Regular adaptation to changing circumstances
