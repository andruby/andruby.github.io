Bruce went back to Barcelona, and I took a plane back to Lisbon. Luckily we both had to take our plane around the same time.We had some time left at the airport and passed this store where they sell sunglasses. In the euphoria of the weekend we became victims of impulsive buying. <br />We both bought these super cool <a href="http://www.ray-ban.com/">Ray-Ban&reg;</a> sunglasses.Yes, we look like Starsky &amp; Hutch now.
