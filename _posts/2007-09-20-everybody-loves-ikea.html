They have absolutely everything to turn an ugly and cold room into a nice and cozy place. And they've got it for a stunning price, which is awesome for an erasmus student on a small budget like myself.I bought this "Storm" lamp to replace the horrid TL-lights and got a nice reddish bedcover to add some colour to the room. I moved the furniture a bit and voila.. A nice room!<strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andruby/tags/roominlisboa/">here</a> you can see all pictures from my room
