There is a special menu for dinner this evening at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/donveggie" title="MySpace.com - Don Veggie">Don Veggie's</a>, so you can eat there before the party (it's 5min walking from the venue!)Ticket pre-sales are on fire, so don't be late.The <a href="http://www.whatscookin.be/event/bryan-jones-vooruit" title="What's Cookin'?
