Pfieuw, I have been in Lisboa for 4 days but I haven't had the time to write anything. So I will try to write a few posts over the next few days..

### Arrival

September 11th, maybe not a good date to take a plane, but everything went just fine. The airport people at Brussels airport didn't complain about our excess luggage and the plane left on time.A little over 3 hours later we (Alec, <a href="http://nathaliekesblog.blogspot.com/">Nathalie</a> &amp; me) arrived in Lisboa with about 35kg of luggage each. Luckily there was a bus-line going straight to the youth-hostel where we booked 2 nights.First thing that struck us when we arrived at Lisboa airport was the excessive use of George Clooney's face in advertisements. Maybe he's a local hero?People in Lisboa are very friendly. The difference with Belgian people is quite big. You can ask anyone for help here.

### First impressions of the city

After dropping our luggage at the hostel we took a walk to the Universidade Nova, the university where we'll be taking our courses this semester. On the way there we crossed Parque Eduardo <em>(foto)</em>. It's a nice park with a lovely view over Marqu&ecirc;s de Pombal.Walking through Lisboa is more exhausting than you think. Streets are very steep, going up and down a lot. They call this city "<a href="http://jokearoundeurope.blogspot.com/2006/11/lisboa-cidade-de-7-colinas.html">Lisboa, cidade de 7 colinas</a>" because it was build on 7 hills. Now I'm starting to see what that means :-)Some parts of Lisboa are really beautiful, some aren't. I guess this is the case for every city this size. I like the colourful houses and the old buildings.We met a nice american named Chris that evening in the bar of the hostel. He was traveling around Europe for 3 weeks. Friendly guy.So that was our first day in Lisboa. I was very tired when I fell asleep, but I felt excited too. Curious about what was going to happen in next days.. 

I will write again soon! Check out the other pictures I took on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andruby/sets/72157602000572814/">this flickr set</a>
