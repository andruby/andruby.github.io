The adventure is over. I am back home, since 30 January. More than a week has passed since than. I meant to write this sooner, but it's been quite busy. So that i will never forget, here is what I did on my last week of erasmus:

* **mon:** (back from Porto) caipirinha + beatrix bar.
* **tue:** caipirinha + minimercado.
* **wed:** beach (sao pedro) + nood (clair's dinner) + caipirinha + shotbar.
* **thu:** new erasmus party at XannaX (crap) + bedroom.
* **fri:** bedroom + didn't get in on BBC guestlist.
* **sat:** met lots of people in Bairro + last time in Lux.
* **sun:** chicken curry at the frenchies.
* **mon:** non-alcoholic evening at Noo Bai and yellow jazz bar.
* **tue:** beach (estoril) + monixken's brithday dinner + chocolate fondue at Daphne's + last minimercado.

Quite a week. And lots of fun. A reminder of the best places (bars) in Lisbon:

* [Noo Bai](http://www.noobaicafe.com/) (miradouro santa catarina) : chill bar with amazing view, [gmaps](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=noobai+cafe,+Miradouro+do+Adamastor,+lisboa&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=38.709479,-9.147846&amp;spn=0.001951,0.003009&amp;z=18)
* [Instituto do vinho do porto](http://goo.gl/maps/kRMcu): port wine tasting in a chill relaxing bar
* [Vou ao Camoes](https://www.facebook.com/VouAoCamoes): aka "the caipirinha shop", sells caipirinha's for 2Eur
* [Maria Caxuxa](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d1014055-Reviews-Maria_Caxuxa-Lisbon_Estremadura.html): nice bar in Bairro
* [Bar sem nom](http://www.guiadacidade.pt/pt/e/bar-sem-nom-25088): aka "the shot bar", 12 shots for 12 euro's, always good music
* Yellow jazz bar: great tosta's and good music
* [Bedroom](http://www.visitar-lisbon.com/en/nightlife/lisbon-bars.html): mini club in Bairro. Nice interior and good sound. Some times good house dj
* [Lux](http://www.luxfragil.com/): the big club of the city. I am a big fan of the downstairs floor (mostly techno)
