I woke up today with a lovely surprise. UPS had delivered my new camera. Amazing. I barely ordered it 24 hours ago on a dutch online shop and it's already here?! What a pleasant surprise. I have to be honest and tell you that I've never had a camera before so I am pretty excited.

Knowing absolutely nothing about photography I had a hard time trying to get a nice outdoor shot. The wet and cloudy weather didn't make things easier, but did provide some beautiful raindrops on leaves and flowers. A great way to test the close-up preset of my Nikon D40. Visit my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andruby">flickr page</a> to see my other pictures.Many thanks to denis from <a href="http://stoneship.org">stoneship.org</a> for pushing me to buy this great camera. 

PS: Yes i know, this is my first blog post. I'll write the <a href="http://andrewsblog.org/about/">about page</a> tomorrow.
