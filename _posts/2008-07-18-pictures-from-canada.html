I uploaded most of my picture's from our vacation in Canada. <br />As always, you can find them <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andruby/sets/72157606023109653/" title="Canada 2008 - a set on Flickr">here</a>.Our trip started in Vancouver on July 4th. We visited Vicatoria, Tofino, Whistler, Clearwater, Jasper, Banff and Canmore. Tomorrow we're going to Calgary for 2 days before we take a plane back home to Belgium (if Belgium will still be one country that is).<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpfarm4static_robdc" height="333" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-tezv-siyx/rCfsieljGptjxuAhmdEIColappkkBCDBxaACFalqvCyzuDpeBaBjlIqDkDyo/media_httpfarm4static_robdC.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" /></div><small><em>Nice view on Canmore after a 2h climb</em></small>
