<p>I have recently been wearing the Software Architect hat more often and so decided to pick up my trusted&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321490452/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andrfechlipp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0321490452">Design Patterns in Ruby</a>&nbsp;book. I reread it and these are my takeaways:</p><p /><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>In your code,<strong> seperate out the things that change from those that stay the same.</strong>&nbsp;This is the ground rule when using patterns and will get you closer to<strong> an Ideal System, where all changes are local</strong>. How? Make the parts in your system as <strong>loosely coupled</strong> as you can. This means programming to an Interface, not an Implementation. This is actually not so different from what Heroku calls&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/6/28/the_new_heroku_4_erosion_resistance_explicit_contracts/">Explicit Contracts</a>.</li><li>Assemble behaviors in modules, and use composition over inheritance.</li><li>Use delegate more often.</li></ul><p /></div><div>Page 15 of the book lists the 14 patterns and gives a concise overview of when to use which pattern.</div><div>Here are my personal "definitions" to help me remember the patterns:</div><p /><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>Template Method: Vary one step.</li><li>Strategy: Vary the whole algorithm. When there are multiple ways to do something and you want to choose at runtime. aka: interchangeable parts</li><li>Adapter: Layer a new interface over an object to make the interface compatible. eg: SmtpAdapter and SmsAdapter.</li><li>Observers: Decouple! Listen to what happens in another class.</li><li>Decorators: Classes that support the same basic interface, making them all chainable. aka: alias_method_chain &amp; extend. see ActiveSupport.</li><li>Proxies: Good for controlling the interface to another object. eg: security, network performance, caching</li><li><a href="http://designpatternsinruby.com/section02/facade.html">Facade</a>: Kind of a proxy that wraps a simple interface over a complex interface.</li></ul><p /></div><div>All Ruby programmers should read&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321490452/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andrfechlipp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0321490452">Design Patterns in Ruby</a>&nbsp;before they start building software with some level of complexity. Also, everybody who wants to understand why Rails is built like it is, or wants to extend/contribute to Rails, read this book!</div>
