I was doing some research about how to give a good presentation when I found one by <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/hans_rosling.html" title="TED | Speakers | Hans Rosling">Hans Rosling</a> about how developing countries are pulling themselves out of poverty.In the video below from <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_on_poverty.html" title="TED | TED Conferences | Past TEDs | TED2007">TED 2007</a>, the master of statistics makes a simple point in a very visual and memorable way: "The seemingly impossible is possible. We can have a good world." Hans showed with statistics what is possible in the world, then he closes with a big, unexpected, and memorable finish.

Really amazing how he can make statistics entertaining, yet powerful in supporting his message. You can find more presentations like this one <a href="http://roslingsblogger.blogspot.com/" title="Hans Rosling's blog">on his blog</a>.(Bumped into this one on <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/09/data-is-not-bor.html" title="Presentation Zen: Hans Rosling: Don't just show the notes, play the music!">Presentation Zen</a>, a blog about presentations)
