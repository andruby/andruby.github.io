Adam Savage (Myth Busters) on Problem Solving:<ol class="MailOutline"><li>Clearly state the problem that you are solving (make sure all party's are completely in sync)</li><li>See the big picture: where does this fit in? How does it fit in? Can you see the whole picture?</li><li>Deadlines can help you focus and thrive. And are a good mental zen when going repetitive work.</li><li>How precise do I have to be? (time-quality tradeoff)</li><li>"Once I am rolling, I want to keep on roling" : put all the tools you need for the task in hand reach so you can stay in the flow.</li><li>"If I get to keep it, I'm more invested" : Ownership = motivation</li><li>Location &amp; surroundings ("the set designer from ideo)</li><li>People: "Is the team too big?"</li><li>Do I have the right skills for this problem? If not: do I have enough time to get good at it to finish it? Do I outsource to someone else?</li><li>Am I missing something stupid: "Is there a simpler way?", "Am I being too clever?"</li><li>What does the big picture look like now that I have solved this particular part?</li><li>There is a point around 75% when you think: I have absolutely no idea what I am doing. That's normal. Non working prototypes are normal!</li><li>There is always a next problem to solve!</li></ol><p /><div><iframe allowfullscreen src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BhAt-7i36G8?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></div>
