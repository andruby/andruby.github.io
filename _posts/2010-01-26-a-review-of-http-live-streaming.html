<p>I wrote a paper about Apple's new HTTP Live Streaming specification/protocol. You can browse it <a href="http://issuu.com/andruby/docs/http_live_streaming?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed">on issuu.com</a> or <a href="http://files.andrewsblog.org/http_live_streaming.pdf">read the pdf</a>.  Those of you who want a shorter introduction: the presentation is available <a href="http://issuu.com/andruby/docs/http_live_streaming_presentatino?viewMode=presentation&amp;mode=embed">on issuu.com</a></p><p>In the paper I describe what HTTP Live Streaming is, fairly technically, and why it is a great step forward. I compare the new technology with the industry incumbent RTP/RTSP protocol and Adobe's proprietary Flash Media Streaming, popularized by <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube.com</a>.  As a teaser: here's a graph of the client CPU Load on a MacBook when viewing the same video clip:</p><p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100125-eeqnam2npuey29jjhf9kw6yifh.png" align="center" alt="Average Client CPU Load: HTTP Live Streaming vs RTP/RTSP vs Flash Media" /></p><p>But I have to warn you, the paper is quite technical.</p>
