On Saturday 15th december we are organizing a special What's Cookin'? edition. We are celebrating the launch of the new logo and website <i>(I'm working overtime on the this!)</i>.I'll be back in Belgium for the weekend, so if you want to join me for this crazy party, <a href="http://andrewsblog.org/2007/12/06/whats-cookin-launch-party/#respond" title="Leave a comment">leave a comment</a> or <a href="mailto:andrew@bedesign.be?subject=What%27s%20Cookin%27%3F%20Launch%20Party">send me an email</a>. <strong>I can arrange tickets</strong>The location of the party will be announced on the new website next week, 13 december. That day we will launch the new website.I've been working hard on the website and I hope it will be a welcome change from the boring and clumsy <a href="http://www.whatscookin.be" title="Old What's Cookin'? website">old site</a> we've all been coping with until now.See you next week!<strong>UPDATE:</strong> We launched the website today.
