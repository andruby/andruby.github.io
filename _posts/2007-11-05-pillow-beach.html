Ha, it's been a while since I posted. I know. It's been a busy week at the university. I'm going to change the way I write blog posts. They've been taking too long to write, which is why I didn't post that often. So from now on, I will try to make posts smaller.<h4>Pillow Beach</h4><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpfarm3static_gkuag" height="160" src="http://getfile0.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-tezv-siyx/hcaiqvJhcljdgexAaDsyrzyyzshyCAtDJAJihFJElgGeertaoEfrsfnGqmqe/media_httpfarm3static_gkuAG.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="240" /></div>The weekend before this one (27 October) we went to a really cool beach near Costa da Caparica. It's a long journey to get there (especially if you take the boat to Trafaria) but it's somewhat worth it.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andruby/1864095623/in/set-72157602918406724" title="Kontiki Bar on Flickr" target="_blank">The Kontiki Bar</a> on this beach is amazing because it has these <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andruby/1864915170/in/set-72157602918406724/" title="The pillows at pillow beach on Flickr - Photo Sharing!" target="_blank">really nice pillows</a> on the sand where you can lay back and relax with a drink while watching the beautiful ocean. Very relaxing. Somewhat like <a href="http://www.limonada.be/" title="Limonada" target="_blank">the Limonada</a> on a beach (A really nice lounge bar in Gent) There were a lot of surfers that day because of the good waves.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpfarm3static_hsjau" height="160" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-tezv-siyx/vwibBzInvGacHJcmCtxppGCrevptHfBDhrxsFkrwxwwHeacihcodacfAplhh/media_httpfarm3static_hsJau.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="240" /></div>I tried to get a little tan, but I guess I have some kind of Irish skin that just doesn't tan.Hints if you want to go there: Take the bus from Pra&ccedil;a de Espanha to Caparica instead of the boat. They don't accept foreign cards, so bring cashPS (for the Belgian readers) : <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andruby/1864131401/in/set-72157602918406724/" title="\&quot; target=">this set</a>
