I've been playing an online F1 manager game for a couple of weeks. <a href="http://www.f1time.com">F1Time</a> is a manager simulation game with great depth and the right level of complexity. I like it.I wrote <a href="http://f1tools.andrewsblog.org">a small tool</a> to extract laptime data from the race reports so it can be easily analyzed in MS Excel. I wrote it as a Sinatra webapp. <a href="http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/">Sinatra</a> is a Ruby DSL for writing small webapps with a minimum amount of code. This tool was written in <a href="http://github.com/andruby/f1time-tools/tree/master/sinatra_app.rb">35 lines of code</a>.It's open source, so you can view (or fork) the sourcecode on <a href="http://github.com/andruby/f1time-tools" title="andruby's f1time-tools on GitHub">github</a>.<strong>F1Time managers:</strong> You can simply copy &amp; paste the html code of your race report <a href="http://f1tools.andrewsblog.org">HERE</a>, and it will generate a table that you can copy/paste into Excel. (to get the html code from the race report: right click and click "View page source")
