It's great to be in Lisbon with all the new people I've met and the friends I have. But from time to time you think about the people who are still in Belgium, in your hometown. Especially family: my mother &amp; father, my brother Bruce and my little sister Daphne. Bruce is also studying abroad, in Barcelona.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpfarm3static_edujf" height="160" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-tezv-siyx/kbmdBDeDpsjspGDjDhoxnukhIFrmAkCesFoGdziAxqsjkaubhjnmdGquqJIm/media_httpfarm3static_eduJf.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="240" /></div>This weekend we were all reunited in Ghent for a big party my mama was throwing with 3 friends of hers. All 4 of them are turning fifty and they wanted to celebrate. They studied pharmacy together in the 70's in Ghent. My mama made a website for this party with <a href="http://4x50.be/souvenirs.htm" title="4x50: Souvenirs" target="_blank">some hilarious pictures</a> of that time. She'll probably update the website with pictures soon: <a href="http://www.4x50.be" title="4x50" target="_blank">www.4x50.be</a>The food was nice and student-like: pitta! hamburgers &amp; fries. The ladies even had to drink a beer <em>ad fundum</em>. Lutje was the winner in this mini-cantus.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpfarm3static_adfme" height="160" src="http://getfile0.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-tezv-siyx/jDDJEkDJbuBiesxgkbldFfegIdxoiymsHgGkblCwndGeiFJCrmFoBvcgxzka/media_httpfarm3static_ADFmE.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="240" /></div>A belgian cover band, <a href="http://www.cocospirit.be/" title="Coco Spirit" target="_blank">Coco Spirit</a>, kicked off the dancing with well played covers of famous songs. The crowd got wild during some french <em>meezingers</em>! The dj's did a nice job in keeping the party mood afterwards. The 4 ladies sure know how to organize a great party.I had a lot of fun with my old mate J&eacute;r&ocirc;me. What a welcome surprise to see him yesterday! It was really nice to chat with him and my cousins again.<a href="http://www.artcube.be/" title="Art Cube" target="_blank">The ArtCube</a>, the venue where the party was, is a nice, big and yet cozy place. It felt like an old warehouse that has been revived for these kinds of parties. You can take a look at the pictures I took with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/gp/11805358@N03/Jj3f49" target="_blank">this flickr guestpass</a>.Today I changed my plane tickets so I could stay one more day. I had a wonderful time here. But it's cold in Belgium so I'm also happy to go back to Lisbon tomorrow.
