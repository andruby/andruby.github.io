<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org" title="Ruby Programming Language">The Ruby programming language</a> creeps up as the 9th most popular programming language on the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.htm?tiobe_index" title="TIOBE Software - The Coding Standards Company">TIOBE Programming Community Index</a>. Slightly overtaking Javascript. Being a Ruby programmer, this is nice news.To my surprise, <a href="http://www.lua.org/" title="The Programming Language Lua">the Lua language</a> (portuguese word for moon) jumped up from the 48th place to the 16th. The language was developed in Brazil and is being used more and more in games. I know that the talented developers from <a href="http://www.unknownworlds.com/" title="Unknown Worlds Entertainment">Unknown Worlds</a> are using it extensively in their upcoming <a href="http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns/" title="Natural Selection">NS2 game</a>. They even wrote <a href="http://www.unknownworlds.com/decoda" title="Decoda">a Lua debugger (decoda)</a> two months ago.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpwwwrubyinsi_cjcoa" height="236" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-tezv-siyx/gzJngGaxjzatAiEAsdkBxcoyfyfewboFhBDFzgzjJbyrCopFiqnyyxamoGrh/media_httpwwwrubyinsi_Cjcoa.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="373" /></div>
