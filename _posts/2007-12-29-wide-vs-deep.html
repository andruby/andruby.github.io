5 days ago in a post named <a href="http://andrewsblog.org/2007/12/23/the-meaning-of-life/">the meaning of life</a> I set a goal to learn something new every week.Yesterday I read <a href="http://blog.eod.com/post/18462877">a well written blogpost</a> about a programmer who moved into management, and back. He comes up with a thought provoking theory about why some people are better managers and others better programmers:<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><em>Managers must work shallow and wide, while programmers must work narrow and deep. People who are naturally tuned to one particular method of work will not only enjoy their jobs a lot more, but be better at them. I didn&rsquo;t say it was a particularly insightful theory.</em></blockquote><a href="http://blog.eod.com/post/18462877">Read the complete post</a> even if you&rsquo;re not interested in management. He makes some good points.Here's my dilemma: I hope I can be both deep and wide. It would be a pity to have studied 5 year of management just to realize that I'm not that kind of guy... ;-)
