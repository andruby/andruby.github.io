Tomorrow was supposed to be a beautiful day in Lisbon: sunny, 17&deg;C and the Paris-Dakar starting here. Unfortunately the Dakar organisers were forced to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/world_rally/7171426.stm" title="BBC SPORT | Motorsport | Rallying | Safety concerns end Dakar Rally">cancel the rally</a> due to safety concerns in Mauritania.<blockquote cite="Amaury Sport Organisation">        <em>Following several consultations with the French government and taking into account its firm recommendations, the organisers of the Dakar have taken the decision to cancel the 2008 edition of the rally</em>        <span style="float: right;"><strong><em><small>Amaury Sport Organisation</small></em></strong></span></blockquote>&nbsp;<br />That really sucks, because I love to watch the rally every year. It's a good break from studying during the exams and the landscapes they pass are <a href="http://www.valeo-motor-sports.com/rallye/actualites_diaporamas/actualite_86_1.jpg" title="">so beautiful</a>.

Most contestants however are still here in Lisbon with their cars and teams. When I came back from my first exam (which went well) I was surprised to see both Hummers of Robby Gordon and Ronn Bailey in the middle of Avenida, just outside the metro station. I took <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andruby/sets/72157603636252267/" title="Dakar Cars - a photoset on Flickr">some pictures</a> of both cars and their support trucks. The Tuareg of Hardy and Lecompte was also parked in front of the Novotel. Nice rides. It kinda sucks to see them here in the middle of the city in stead of in the desert sand.
