<h4>Expo 98</h4><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpfarm2static_qetbb" height="240" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-tezv-siyx/hCapapdfHoAeqrzxmispGzakjgfJoBvbJGipBkfajyjhfkvHfgxizgAHxGbk/media_httpfarm2static_qetbB.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="160" /></div>Today we finally got our metro &amp; bus pass. That took a while. We've been trying to get one for 3 days, but it seems we always arrive a few minutes after closing time.In the afternoon Alec and I joined Anne, Andy &amp; Monika from our apartment at the expo 98 part of Lisbon. It's a modern, high-rise building area with some nice architecture. Lovely fountains there as you can see. Although I like the modern buildings and the Vasco da Gama bridge, I prefer the cozy and older houses of the Bairro Alto area.<em>( someone will be happy I took this picture :) )</em><h4>Vanilla Sky</h4><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpfarm2static_whshl" height="160" src="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-tezv-siyx/hednauuxsBzelexJGgcFkmHprwFoypzCdmwarFnqcrHvjCBwhauCuBiEgCBk/media_httpfarm2static_wHshl.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="240" /></div>When we got back, the light of the sunset through the clouds gave everything a gorgeous colour. Somewhat of a vanilla sky as you can see in this picture. <em>(more pictures on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andruby/" title="Flickr: Photos from andruby">my flickr account</a>)</em><br /><h4>Lightning storm</h4><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpfarm2static_jphbr" height="160" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-tezv-siyx/CenbpwwCqufdgHAAukkiqlxrduDcbCqdoJavwAEyytGijHbdAFqigkwqJEFG/media_httpfarm2static_jpHbr.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="240" /></div>Back at our apartment we ate a decent telepizza we picked up on the way home. While we were chatting it started to rain, and a few minutes later we could hear thunderstorms. This was the first time I tried to take pictures of lightning so they are far from perfect. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andruby/tags/lightning/" title="Flickr: andruby's photos tagged with lightning">Here are a few others i took this evening</a>
