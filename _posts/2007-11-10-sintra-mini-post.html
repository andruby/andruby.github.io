Ai ai ai, I've been so busy on my product innovation project this week that I didn't have time to post about our visit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintra" title="Wikipedia Entry: Sintra" target="_blank">Sintra</a> last thursday.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Media_httpfarm3static_xcdha" height="160" src="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-tezv-siyx/nkAphAHhFtgJvGyIHJcsEzrehhlpxDlznowAzGbIbnrnjEbluanqpuJkEjBc/media_httpfarm3static_xCDhA.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="240" /></div>I did upload my pictures <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andruby/sets/72157602920758764/" title="Sintra - a photoset on Flickr" target="_blank">here</a> a few days ago. We visited the Pena Palace and the amazing Castelo dos Mouros.Nathalie and me had a lovely diner that evening for our 3 year anniversary, joepie! :-) Time really flies when you're having fun.But now I have to get back to work: We have to hand in our preliminary report in just 2 days :-/ bummer
